# Chapter 1 

This is a markdown template that can be integrated into the full book.

Please proceed in this way:

* Copy chapter1.Rmd to a new file, rename as you see fit.
* Append the file path to **_bookdown.yml** in the root folder, e.g. **rmd_files: ["index.Rmd","chapter1.Rmd",...]**
* Write your markdown, save, commit and push.
* The book will be built automatically when pushed and is available at [ekstroem.github.io](https://ekstroem.github.io/UEFA2020-prediction-competition/)

```{r include=FALSE }

print("Begin markdown from here...")

```
